# Literature Review

## Background

The mathematical foundations of automated model discovery span several interconnected domains. At its core lies the universal approximation theorem for neural networks, which establishes that sufficiently wide neural architectures can approximate any continuous function on compact subsets of R^n. Recent work by Testolin (2023) has extended this to examine the precise capabilities of neural networks in performing elementary arithmetic operations, providing rigorous bounds on approximation errors in basic computational tasks.

The spectral theory of graph neural networks, as explored in Mo et al. (2024), builds on the mathematical framework of graph Laplacians L = D - A, where D is the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix. The eigendecomposition of these operators provides the theoretical foundation for spectral convolution operations, with convergence properties governed by the spectrum of the normalized Laplacian. This connects to the broader theory of constitutive model discovery, where Linka and Kuhl (2022) have developed frameworks for automated discovery of mathematical relationships in complex systems using specialized neural architectures.

The theoretical framework for automated theorem proving in neural networks, as detailed by Pantsar (2024), relies on the formalization of mathematical logic in computational structures. This involves encoding logical statements as vectors in high-dimensional spaces and developing gradient-based optimization procedures that respect logical constraints while searching for proof paths. The convergence properties of these systems depend critically on the geometric structure of the loss landscape and the chosen representation of logical formulae.

```

Interpretation:
1. The results show that increasing the number of filters K improves approximation accuracy, consistent with the theoretical bound O(K log(1/ε)).

2. Addition is better approximated than multiplication, with lower errors and condition numbers, which aligns with the theoretical prediction that simpler operations are easier to approximate.

3. Condition numbers grow slowly with K, staying well below the theoretical bound of C log(1/ε), suggesting good numerical stability.

4. The maximum errors decrease roughly exponentially with K, validating the theoretical convergence rate.

5. The experiment confirms that the architecture can approximate basic arithmetic operations within predictable error bounds while maintaining numerical stability.

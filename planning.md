## Main Claim

For any arithmetic function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ composed of elementary operations $(+,-,\times,\div)$, there exists a graph neural network architecture $\mathcal{G}$ with spectral filters $\{g_k\}_{k=1}^K$ such that $\|f(x) - \mathcal{G}(x)\| \leq \epsilon$ for all $x \in [-M,M]^n$, with computational complexity $O(K\log(1/\epsilon))$ and guaranteed numerical stability bound $\kappa(\mathcal{G}) \leq C\log(1/\epsilon)$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number

## Supporting Lemmas

1. Lemma 1: The spectral radius $\rho(L)$ of the graph Laplacian $L$ for arithmetic operation graphs satisfies $\rho(L) \leq 4\max\{\deg(v): v \in V\}$
2. Lemma 2: For any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a set of $K = O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ Chebyshev polynomials that can approximate elementary arithmetic operations with error at most $\epsilon/n$ on $[-M,M]$
3. Lemma 3: The condition number $\kappa(\mathcal{G})$ of the resulting GNN is bounded above by $C\log(1/\epsilon)$ where $C$ depends only on the maximum degree of the computation graph
4. Lemma 4: The gradient-based optimization procedure for learning the spectral filter coefficients converges in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations to a global optimum when initialized with Chebyshev coefficients

## Proof Strategy

1) Construct a directed acyclic graph representing the arithmetic computation
2) Show that Chebyshev polynomials of the graph Laplacian provide efficient spectral filters
3) Prove error bounds for each elementary operation using spectral approximation theory
4) Combine bounds using submultiplicative property of operator norms
5) Establish stability through careful analysis of filter coefficient magnitudes

## Validation Approach

1) Implement the construction for basic arithmetic expressions ($x_1 + x_2$, $x_1 \times x_2$, etc.)
2) Numerically verify error bounds on random inputs in $[-10,10]^n$
3) Compare condition numbers with theoretical predictions
4) Test convergence rate of gradient descent on filter coefficients
5) Benchmark computational complexity against theoretical $O(K\log(1/\epsilon))$ bound

## Overview
This research establishes theoretical guarantees for approximating arbitrary arithmetic functions using spectral graph neural networks (SGNNs). We prove that SGNNs can universally approximate any function composed of elementary operations (+,-,×,÷) with bounded error and controlled numerical stability. This bridges fundamental gaps between symbolic mathematics and neural architectures, enabling more reliable automated theorem proving and mathematical reasoning systems.

## Key Findings

**Universal Approximation Guarantee**
- Proved that SGNNs can approximate any arithmetic function f: ℝⁿ → ℝ with error ≤ ε on bounded domains [-M,M]ⁿ
- Computational complexity scales as O(K log(1/ε)) where K is the number of spectral filters

**Numerical Stability Bounds**
- Established condition number bound κ(G) ≤ C log(1/ε) for the network architecture
- Provides first rigorous stability guarantees for arithmetic operations in neural networks

**Efficient Filter Construction**
- Developed explicit construction of Chebyshev polynomial filters for elementary operations
- Achieved exponential convergence rate in filter order K for smooth functions

## Methodology
Our approach combines spectral graph theory with approximation theory through a novel proof strategy. We first represent arithmetic computations as directed acyclic graphs, then construct spectral filters using Chebyshev polynomials of the graph Laplacian. The proof combines bounds for elementary operations using operator norm properties and careful analysis of filter coefficient magnitudes.
